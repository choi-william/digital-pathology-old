This MATLAB code is distributed in support of the paper:
Leo Grady and Christopher Alvino, "The Piecewise Smooth Mumford-Shah
Functional on an Arbitrary Graph", IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, Vol.
18, No. 11, Nov. 2009.

Please cite this work whenever this code is used in publication.


The combinatorial Mumford-Shah solution is given by the function "combinatorial_mumford_shah()".  An example of how to use the code with one of the images from the paper is given by the script "example_script".  The remaining functions are simply support functions for the main MS function.

In order to use this code, it is assumed that you have installed in your path the Graph Analysis Toolbox, which is available online at:
